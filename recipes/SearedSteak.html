        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Pan-Seared Steak has a garlic rosemary-infused butter that makes it taste steakhouse quality. <br>You will be impressed at how easy it is to make the perfect steak – seared and caramelized on the outside, and so juicy inside.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>New York Strip Steak</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic cloves</li>
            <li>Rosemary sprigs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Pat dry</b> - use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
            <li><b>Season generously</b> - just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><b>Preheat the pan</b> - on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
            <li><b>Sear steaks</b> – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
            <li><b>Add butter and aromatics</b> - melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li><b>Remove steak</b> and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What to Serve with Steaks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Roasted Asparagus or Roasted Brussels Sprouts</li>
            <li>Creamy Mashed Potatoes</li>
            <li>Oven-roasted Baby Red Potatoes</li>
            <li>Another classic steak pairing is Corn on the Cob</li>
            <li>Chimichurri Sauce is a quick way to add tons of flavor</li>
        </ul>
